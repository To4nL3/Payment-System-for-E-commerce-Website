# Part 4: Implementation

The implementation process includes the implementation of the user interface, which is coded using JavaScript and only viewable through a browser. Next is the program, the payment system, which is coded with Java through Eclipse. The database storing the website’s data will be programmed using SQL and supported by Oracle.

Screenshots have been taken of the system and UI and are as follows:

Login: Users can login to their accounts to access their user information and to update their user information as well.

New User: Allows users with no account to create one with the input of basic information. This gives them the ability to store payment credentials in the database and to update any information thereafter.

Account Information Display: This page allows the user to see their stored information located in the database. On this page, the user is given the ability to update any payment information.

Update Payment Info: This page allows users to access their stored payment information from the database and update it with more current information. This page is accessed through the ‘Account Information Display’ page.


Shopping Cart: This page concerns itself with storing any ‘saved’ items that the customer wants to purchase from the store. It also contains a way for the customer to check out, see the total price of the items, see the quantity of each item, and the individual prices of the items.


Checkout Page: When the user proceeds to the checkout page, they will be able to choose a shipping option and view the total cost of their order, including tax. If the user does not have an account, they can enter their payment information and billing address here. If the user does have an account, they can click the link at the top of the page. They will then be redirected to the login page. If the information on the checkout page looks correct, the user can place the order.


Admin Transaction Management Page: This page is used solely by the administrator of the system (i.e., owner of business). Its purpose is to allow the admin full control over the transactions that have taken place on their store. If an edit is needed to be made to correct an error, or if an entire transaction is needed to be deleted
