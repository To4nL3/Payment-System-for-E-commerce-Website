# Part 1: Planning

## 1.1 Introduction About the Problem Domain
People like to shop online because it is efficient. Moreover, they do not have to go out to physical stores in order to buy the products they need. However, it is not easy for the owner of an e-commerce store to provide customers with fast and convenient services. Setting up a secure online payment process can be challenging as it requires continuous monitoring and improvements.

Nowadays, e-commerce has various payment methods that offer low transaction fees, have various currency options, and provide cashless services. This system is being developed to satisfy this demand by online retailers and to serve the consumer with fast and convenient checkout services.
