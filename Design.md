## 3.3 Database Diagram

The database design is shown below.

As shown in the diagram, the Shopping Cart Table is an Association table used between the Account Table and the Order Table.

The Account Table stores basic information about a user account, such as username, password, payment information, etc. The Order Table stores information about the user’s order, such as the order number, total, and status. The Shopping Cart Table stores information about the items that the customer has stored for future purchase. Finally, the Transaction Table is used to store information regarding all past transactions/orders for administrative purposes.
